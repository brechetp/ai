Propositional logic --  Readme

prop_logic.py is a Python v2.7 script. It contains all functions (lex, parser, tautology, etc.) as well as some constant data (used for the lexer).

test_file.py is the file containing the solutions to the questions. 

Both scripts must be in the same folder for test_file to work.

I've written my code on a Macintosh computer (on vim), so some special character (\t, \n) may be acting surprisingly on a Windows environment.

Usage: python test_file.py
